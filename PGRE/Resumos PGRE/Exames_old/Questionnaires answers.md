## Questionaire PGRE


1- False. Availability represents the probability of the system **being operating when requested** MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR)

2- True(?) - using virtualization.

3- False. **Both data sinks and data sources** need to be determine.

4- False. In **peer-to-peer** both applications and users are similar.

5- False. From the point of view of capacity, **Rate-critical** applications must be considered.

6- False. The **"last-mile"** problem is identified as the difficulty in getting infrastructure, networking and services into a building or campus.
		  The **"last-foot"** problem however, is identified as the difficulty in getting the services and required perfomance from the networks interfaces throught applications and users.
		  
7- False. **"Real-time" relates to delay** and **Telnet is non real-time application**.

8- False. MTBF is **not a % value** and represents the **mean time between failures** - meaning the time in which the system is working as expected.

9- False. **Out-band monitoring isn't related to remotely probes**. Out-band monitoring reffers to a separated monitoring enviroment 
		  -> production and management go on different networks.
		  
10- False. Scalability measures how the system can grow and expand/scale to support a **bigger solution, NOT more of the same solution** - a better exmaple would be the throughput of said interfaces (allowing more Gbit/s)
